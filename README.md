# Development of a line-following grid solver robot

A grid-solver robot that can map a grid containing objects, obstacles and bridges, calculate the shortest and easiest path and then navigate back while picking up certain objects. PID and Djisktra's algorithms were used for line following and for calculating the shortest paths on the grid, respectively.
